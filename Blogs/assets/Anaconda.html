    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Introduction To Anaconda</h1>
    <p>Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages
         for scientific computing and data science. It is designed to simplify the process of installing
         , managing, and updating packages and libraries necessary for data analysis, machine learning,
          and other related tasks.

        Anaconda includes a variety of popular tools and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib,
         Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, and others, as well as its own package manager, conda. With 
         conda, users can easily install, manage, and update packages and dependencies, making it easier to work with complex packages and software libraries.
        
        Anaconda also includes a virtual environment management system, which allows users to create 
        and manage multiple isolated environments for different projects or tasks. This makes it easier 
        to keep track of different versions of packages and dependencies, and helps to prevent conflicts 
        between packages.
        
        Overall, Anaconda is a popular and powerful platform for data science and scientific computing, 
        and is widely used by data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and researchers in academia 
        and industry.

        <p>To create a new environment in Anaconda, follow these steps:<br>

            1. Open the Anaconda prompt. You can do this by typing "Anaconda Prompt" into the 
            search bar on your computer.<br>
            
            2. At the prompt, type the following command to create a new environment 
            called "myenv" with Python 3.8:<br>
            3. run code conda create -n myenv python=3.8<br>
            4. You can specify a different Python version or package list if desired. 
            For example, to create an environment with Python 2.7 and the packages numpy and pandas
            , you would use the following command:<br>
            5. " conda create -n myenv python=2.7 numpy pandas "<br>
            6. To activate the environment, type the following command:<br>
            7. "conda activate myenv"<br>
            8. To deactivate the environment, type the following command:<br>
            9. conda deactivate<br>
